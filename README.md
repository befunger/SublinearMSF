# SublinearMSF
An algorithm design project for creating a sub-linear approximation algorithm for the Minimum Spanning Forest problem, an extention of the [Minimum Spanning Tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_spanning_tree) problem allowing multiple disconnected graph components.

The Minimum Spanning Forest PDF contains a project report explaining and proving the correctness of the implemented algorithm.
